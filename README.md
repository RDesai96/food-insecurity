# food-insecurity
An analysis of food deserts using data from the U.S. Census
STAT 684 - Texas A&M

This exploration of food insecurity in the U.S. seeks to build a model that can predict whether a given Census Tract
is "food insecure" using economic and demographic information (i.e. ethnic breakdown, income, etc). A Census Tract
is a geographic region used by the U.S. Census Bureau, usually consisting of a region with about 4,500 people.
Data was obtained from the USDA's Food Atlas, and for convenience this dataset is available at:
